# Proximity searches

allow a term to be in between the searched text -> slop(помои, to slop расплескивать)
slop - int  means how far apart terms are allowed to be (how many times terms may be moved) 

## Adding test documents

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/1
{
  "title": "Spicy Sauce"
}
```

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/2
{
  "title": "Spicy Tomato Sauce"
}
```

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/3
{
  "title": "Spicy Tomato and Garlic Sauce"
}
```

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/4
{
  "title": "Tomato Sauce (spicy)"
}
```

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/5
{
  "title": "Spicy and very delicious Tomato Sauce"
}
```
