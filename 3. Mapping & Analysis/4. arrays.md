# Understanding arrays

- No such type
- Array should always be the same data type ("true" and true are allowed but not recommended)
- ([{object}, {object}, true] - will not work)
- The none text arrays are not analyzed
- coercion only works if mapping already created
- Nested arrays will be flattened

Reminder: Use the nested data type for arrays ob object if you need to query them independently

## Arrays of strings are concatenated when analyzed (with space between elements)
