# Understanding type coercion (принуждение,сдерживание)
data types are inspected when indexing documents
 - They are validated are some invalid values are rejected

Few more things:
- float supplied for integer field will be converted to integer
- coercion is not used for dynamic mapping
- always try to use the correct data type
- enabled by default

## Supplying a floating point

```
PUT /coercion_test/_doc/1
{
  "price": 7.4 
}
Elastic figured out the type of the price field with help of dynamic mapping
```

## Supplying a floating point within a string

```
PUT /coercion_test/_doc/2
{
  "price": "7.4"
}
Here type coercion comes. Elastic coerce (try to convert) string field into float type with existing mapping 

BUT NOTE THAT: 
GET /coercion_test/_doc/2
will return
  "_source" : {
    "price" : "7.4"
  } 
That's cause _sourse contains the values that were supplied at index time ("7.4")
Search quesries use indexed values and not _source (BKD trees, inverted indices so on)
_source does not reflect how values are indexed (keep coercion in mind if you use _source)
```

## Supplying an invalid value

```
PUT /coercion_test/_doc/3
{
  "price": "7.4m"
}
```

## Retrieve document

```
GET /coercion_test/_doc/2
```

## Clean up

```
DELETE /coercion_test
```
