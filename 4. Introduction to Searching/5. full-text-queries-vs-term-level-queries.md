# Full text queries vs term level queries

Term query searches for exact value and NOT analyzed
the lobster will match cause it went through standard analyzer and was transformed to lowercase in inverted index
And Lobster will not match cause Lobster does not exist in inverted index

Full text query goes through the same analysis process as object at indexing time did. So Lobster will match because
it was analyzed and converted 

## Term level queries are not analyzed

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "name": "lobster"
    }
  }
}
```

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "name": "Lobster"
    }
  }
}
```

## Full-text queries are analyzed

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "Lobster"
    }
  }
}
```
