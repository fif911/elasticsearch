# Indexing documents

The ID stored as STRING !

## Indexing document with auto generated ID:

```
POST /products/_doc
{
  "name": "Coffee Maker",
  "price": 64,
  "in_stock": 10
}
```

## Indexing document with custom ID:

PUT /products/_doc/100 {object}. DO NOT UPDATE THE DOC. It's REPLACES its with NEW passed object

```
PUT /products/_doc/100
{
  "name": "Toaster",
  "price": 49,
  "in_stock": 4
}
```

Also works (check if it replaces also):

```POST /products/_doc/100
{
  "doc": {
    "name": "Toaster v2",
    "tags": ["electronics","1"]
  }
}```
