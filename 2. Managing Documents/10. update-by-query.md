# Update by query
Any update by query creates a snapshot to do optimistic concurrency control
Bulk request is send to update the filtered docs by Elastic 
If document has been modified since taking a snapshot the query is aborted (this is checked with the document's primary
term and sequence number)
To count version conflicts instead of aborting the query - set conflicts=proceed

## Updating documents matching a query

Replace the `match_all` query with any query that you would like.

```
POST /products/_update_by_query
{
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.in_stock--"
  },
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```

## Ignoring (counting) version conflicts

The `conflicts` key may be added as a query parameter instead, i.e. `?conflicts=proceed`.

```
POST /products/_update_by_query
{
  "conflicts": "proceed",
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.in_stock--"
  },
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```

## Matches all of the documents within the `products` index

```
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```
