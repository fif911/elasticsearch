# Updating documents

Under the hood Elastic replaces all the documents cause document is immutable type


## Updating an existing field

Note: _update API does not work with PUT

```
POST /products/_update/100
{
  "doc": {
    "in_stock": 3
  }
}

NOTE THAT
PUT /products/_doc/100 {object}. DO NOT UPDATE THE DOC. It's REPLACES its with NEW passed object 
```

## Adding a new field

_Yes, the syntax is the same as the above. ;-)_

```
POST /products/_update/100
{
  "doc": {
    "tags": ["electronics"]
  }
}
```
